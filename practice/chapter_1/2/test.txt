[Verse 1]
Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
Motivate your anger to make them all realize
Climbing the mountain, never coming down
Break into the contents, never falling down

[Verse 2]
My knee is still shaking like I was twelve
Sneaking out the classroom by the back door
A man railed at me twice, though, but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting for people like me

[Chorus]
Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

[Post-Chorus]
You say "Dreams, are dreams"
I ain't gonna play the fool, anymore
You say "'Cause I've still got my soul!"
