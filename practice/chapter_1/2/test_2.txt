[Verse 3]
Take your time, baby, your blood needs slowing down
Breach yourself to reach yourself before you gloom
Reflections of fear make shadows of nothing
Shadows of nothing (Shadow of nothing)

[Bridge]
You still are blind if you see a winding road
'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see

[Chorus]
Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

[Outro]
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
