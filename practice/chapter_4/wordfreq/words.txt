The rain fell, and the rain kept falling. It was a gentle rain, a steady rain, the kind of rain that soaked the earth slowly, as if the rain had all the time in the world. The rain danced on the rooftops, trickling down gutters, forming small rivers on the streets. Every drop of rain seemed to have its own purpose, its own journey, as it joined with other drops of rain, flowing together in a never-ending rhythm. The trees swayed in the rain, their branches heavy with rain, their leaves dripping with rain that gathered in shimmering droplets before falling to the ground.

She watched the rain from her window, the sound of rain filling the room. It was a soothing sound, a calming sound, the sound of rain tapping against the glass. The rain made everything seem distant, blurred, as if the world outside was wrapped in a curtain of rain. She could feel the coolness of the rain even from inside, imagining how the rain would feel on her skin, how the rain would soak her clothes, how the rain would run down her face, her hands, her arms. The rain washed over everything, washing away the dust, the dirt, the noise of the day.

The rain was relentless. It drummed against the roof, dripped from the eaves, splashed into puddles that reflected the gray sky above. The rain seemed to have no end, as though the rain could fall forever, as though the rain had always been falling. The streets were empty, except for the rain, and the rain filled the silence with its soft, steady rhythm. She watched the rain, thought about the rain, wondered how long the rain would last, how long it would take before the rain stopped. But the rain didn’t stop. It just kept falling. Rain, rain, rain.

The world outside was rain. The sky was rain. The ground was rain. Everything was rain, and it was as if nothing else existed but rain. The rain washed over the rooftops, the rain flowed through the streets, the rain gathered in the gutters, and the rain continued its endless journey. She couldn’t help but wonder if the rain would ever end, or if the rain would go on forever, as if the rain had no beginning and no end. Rain upon rain upon rain, each drop of rain joining the next in a symphony of rain.
