I received 3 packages today, but only 2 of them had the correct items. The first package contained 5 books, while the second had 12 markers, but the last one had just 1 pair of socks instead of the 7 I ordered. It's frustrating because I've been waiting for 14 days, and now I'll have to wait another 4-6 days for the replacement. My order number is 8675309, and I hope the support team resolves this quickly.
